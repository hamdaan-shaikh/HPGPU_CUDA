We allocate on the heap memory instead of the stack (i.e. we do int* abc instead of int abc) because, by default, the stack memorz is limited to 8192 KB. Last time we could assign 2 vectors of 1 million because, 2 vectors barely fit as each vector is almostt 4 KB
We can check the stack siye with the command ulimit -a

in this lab we want to assign 3 vectors of 1Mill so the stack would overflow

so we can overocome this bz tzping in the terminal
ulimit -s unlimited    this will remove the limits on the stack memory

or we can use int* instead of int and allocate memory on heap instead of stack



second point

we can serialize the parallel kernel program by running it on only one block and one thread

if we do that we can have print statements and use it to debug on the GPU
